# NN-VQA

In the paper [*Neural network encoded variational quantum algorithms*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01068), we introduce a general framework called neural network encoded variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), or NN-VQA for short, to address the challenges of implementing VQAs on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers.
